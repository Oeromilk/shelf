# Shelf

This is version 2.0 of the Shelf App. :baseball:

## Explanation

The intent of this app is to allow fans to figure out the most ideal
location to sit in any given ballpark to catch a home run.

Using simple data from previous caught home runs we will be able to
create "heat maps" in seating charts to showcase where you should sit.

## Features

Standard features include:

* Ability to manage and track personal home runs.
* See top users and how many home runs they have.
* Search specific ball parks for heat maps.
* Toggle site theme for favorite team or just default.
